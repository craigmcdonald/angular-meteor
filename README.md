## Angular Meteor for 1.1.0.3

This is an experimental version of [Angular-Meteor](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor), with a view to using it with Crosswalk on Cordova.

It is tested against a devel branch of Meteor by [Igor1201](https://github.com/Igor1201/meteor) which is patched with [these patches](https://gist.github.com/Igor1201/5794e44204d7d1d70c83).

I'd probably not use this if I were you...
